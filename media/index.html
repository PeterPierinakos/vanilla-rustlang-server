      Hello! If you see this, then that means that you have successfully set up
      VRS. This is the stock page for the index.html, and you are free to edit
      it inside the static files directory you have specified in your
      configuration file.
    </p>
    <h2>Why VRS?</h2>
    <p>
      VRS is way more efficient with RAM usage than most of the other static web
      servers which aren't written in Rust. Additionally, it doesn't use any
      dependencies whatsoever for better compile times. It's especially
      recommended to try on older hardware and see how it performs with or
      without multithreading.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to do anything besides GET requests, then you should look for
      another lightweight web server as this project's only purpose is to serve
      static HTML.
    </p>
